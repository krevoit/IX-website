# IX-website
Website for internet exchange points.

### Install
On the non-forked version, I encountered errors installing and compiling the program and site. So I have made a fork, where you can just modify it by HTML,

### Modifying HTML content

* You can modify the main website using:
* `index.html`
* And for logos, css, etc.
* `/static` directory

The content you can upload & modify without compiling it is in the upload folder.
